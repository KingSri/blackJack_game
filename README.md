//User Story
As a new software Engineering student, I wanted to take the concepts that I had learned over the past three weeks and apply them into a project so that I could see what I could build and where I could make improvements.

The purpose of this project is to design a blackjack game. 

Rules of BlackJack are simple. Below are my modified rules to play the game. 
i. The goal of the game is to hit 21 with the cards that you have in your hand. Go over, and user will lose. 
i. the user will click bet and the game will begin. Player will be dealt cards and dealer will also be dealt cards.
ii. Money will be stored in the Current Amount Variable, while score will reflect the sum of the held cards in hand.
iv. User can hit stay
iv.i. Stay will not add any changes to user hand, and will instead play dealer's turn
iv.ii. Dealer will keep drawing cards till the sum of his cards is between 17 to 21.
iv.iii. After dealer draws cards, the win condition function will activate and player score will be compared witht he dealer score. Whoever matches the conditions (ie. being under 21 but having the higher sum of cards) will win that round.
